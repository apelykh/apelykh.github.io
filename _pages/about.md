I am a Deep Learning Researcher with experience in computer vision, 3D and audio recognition. Currently pursuing a PhD in the **Cognitive Vision Lab** at the **University of Surrey** under the supervision of [Prof. Richard Bowden](https://personalpages.surrey.ac.uk/r.bowden/). My work deals with **human image/video generation** for producing content in sign language.

Previously, I have been working for **Zibra AI**, **Digital Reasoning** (acquired by Smarsh), **Star**, **Samsung Research Ukraine**. I also hold degrees from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) and [National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”](https://kpi.ua).


[[Hiring!]](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/phd-in-computer-vision-and-deep-learning/?p169271) Our lab is always looking for strong, self-motivated PhD students. If you are interested in generative modeling with applications in sign language, please email me.
